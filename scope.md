# Scope Definition

## 📌 Purpose
This document defines the **scope and boundaries** of the Incident Response Playbook inspired by the AlexLab security incidents (2024–2025).

A clear scope ensures that incident response efforts remain **focused, effective, and aligned with organizational priorities** during a security event.

---

## 🎯 In-Scope Incidents
This playbook applies to the following types of incidents:

- Smart contract exploitation or unexpected contract behavior
- Compromise of private keys (hot wallets, admin keys, multisig participants)
- Abnormal or malicious on-chain transactions
- DeFi protocol manipulation (liquidity drains, oracle abuse, flash-loan impact)
- Bridge or cross-chain related incidents
- Unauthorized protocol parameter changes

---

## 🚫 Out-of-Scope Incidents
The following scenarios are **not covered** by this playbook:

- Development of exploits or attack proof-of-concepts
- Penetration testing procedures
- Source code review for vulnerability discovery
- Social engineering attacks targeting individual users
- Non-crypto related IT incidents (e.g., traditional phishing campaigns, malware infections)
- Regulatory or legal investigation procedures beyond initial notification

---

## 🧩 Assumptions
This playbook assumes that:

- The organization has basic logging and monitoring capabilities
- On-chain data is publicly accessible
- Incident response decisions are coordinated with technical and management teams
- External auditors or blockchain analytics providers may be involved when required

---

## 👥 Target Audience
This playbook is intended for:

- SOC Analysts (Level 1 / Level 2)
- Cybersecurity Analysts
- Risk & Compliance (GRC) professionals
- Junior security professionals entering Web3 environments

---

## 🔄 Scope Review
The scope of this playbook should be **reviewed and updated** after:
- Major protocol changes
- New types of attacks in the crypto ecosystem
- Post-incident lessons learned

---

## ✅ Summary
Defining scope is a **critical first step** in any incident response process.  
This document ensures that response actions remain **clear, coordinated, and actionable** during high-pressure situations.
