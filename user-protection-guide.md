- Be cautious with **new or unaudited protocols**.  
- Monitor for sudden changes in **liquidity pools, bridges, or token contracts**.

### 3. Monitoring & Alerts

- Follow **trusted analytics providers** for anomaly detection.  
- Track community reports of suspicious activity.

### 4. Diversification & Risk Management
