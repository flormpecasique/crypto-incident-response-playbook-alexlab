# AlexLab Crypto Incident Response Playbook (2024–2025)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **defensive Incident Response (IR) Playbook** inspired by the real-world security incidents suffered by **AlexLab** during 2024 and 2025.

The purpose of this project is **educational and preventive**:  
to demonstrate how a cybersecurity analyst should **prepare for, detect, contain, and recover from crypto-related security incidents**, without reproducing exploits or sensitive attack techniques.

This playbook is designed for **SOC Analysts, Cybersecurity Analysts, and GRC-oriented roles** interested in Web3 / crypto security from a **Blue Team perspective**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze crypto security incidents from an **incident response perspective**
- Define **clear response steps** for smart contract / DeFi-related attacks
- Provide a **structured, repeatable framework** usable by security teams
- Demonstrate professional documentation and analytical skills

---

## 🛡️ Scope
This playbook focuses on:
- DeFi / Web3 platforms
- Smart contract–related incidents
- Bridge or protocol-level security breaches
- Key compromise and abnormal on-chain activity

**Out of scope:**
- Exploit development
- Proof-of-concept attack code
- Instructions for abusing vulnerabilities

## 🔍 Incident Response Lifecycle
This playbook follows a simplified IR lifecycle adapted to crypto environments:

1. Preparation  
2. Detection & Analysis  
3. Containment  
4. Eradication  
5. Recovery  
6. Post-Incident Review  

Each phase is documented with **practical actions and decision-making criteria**.
